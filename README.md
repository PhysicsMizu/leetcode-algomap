# AlgoMap.io Roadmap Solutions

### Welcome to my AlgoMap.io Roadmap Solutions repository! This repo is where I store my solutions to various algorithmic problems, as I progress through the structured roadmap provided by AlgoMap.io. My aim is to tackle these problems to build a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving skills.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into folders based on the main topics covered in the roadmap. Each folder contains problem statements, solutions, and occasionally notes or additional resources. Solutions are primarily written in Python, but other languages may be added as I explore them.

Problems and solutions are stored together as jupyter notebooks, with one test case, the problem description,solution, and link to the leetcode problem.
